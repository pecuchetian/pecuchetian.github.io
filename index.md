# Presentation

Born in 1977, I have recently finished a degree in Applied Data Science. Long time ago, though, my first coding project used Action Script in Adobe Flash. I taught myself web design by working in different projects back in the day: CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL where the tools of the trade. I developed apps with Ionic and AngularJS for personal enjoyment. Lately I've learned OOP with Java and worked extensively with R and Python as part of my Data Science training. I'm a Linux user on desktop and server.
